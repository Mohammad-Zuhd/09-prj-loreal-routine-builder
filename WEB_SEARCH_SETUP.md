# Web Search Integration Setup Guide

## Overview

This guide will help you set up web search capabilities for your L'OrÃ©al Routine Builder chatbot.

## Requirements Met

âœ… **Product Search (10 pts)** - Already implemented in your app
âœ… **RTL Language Support (5 pts)** - Already implemented with CSS and JavaScript
âœ… **Web Search (10 pts)** - New implementation provided

## Setting Up Web Search

### Option 1: Deploy New Cloudflare Worker (Recommended)

1. **Create a new Cloudflare Worker:**

   - Go to Cloudflare Dashboard â†’ Workers & Pages
   - Click "Create application" â†’ "Create Worker"
   - Replace the default code with `cloudflare-worker-websearch.js`

2. **Set Environment Variables:**

   ```
   OPENAI_API_KEY = your_openai_api_key
   BING_SEARCH_API_KEY = your_bing_search_key (optional)
   ```

3. **Get Bing Search API Key (Optional but Recommended):**

   - Visit Microsoft Azure Cognitive Services
   - Create a Bing Search v7 resource
   - Copy the API key to your Worker environment variables

4. **Update your script.js:**
   - Change `OPENAI_API_URL` to your new Worker URL
   - The code is already updated to use web search

### Option 2: Update Existing Worker

If you already have a working Cloudflare Worker, you can update it with the web search functionality from `cloudflare-worker-websearch.js`.

## How Web Search Works

### 1. Automatic Detection

The system automatically detects when users ask for current information using keywords like:

- "current"
- "latest"
- "recent"
- "new"
- "trend"

### 2. Search Enhancement

When web search is triggered:

- Extracts relevant search terms from user queries
- Performs web search for current L'OrÃ©al and beauty information
- Includes search results in the AI's context
- AI provides responses with current information and sources

### 3. User Experience

- Users can ask: "What are the latest L'OrÃ©al skincare trends?"
- Users can ask: "Any recent reviews for these products?"
- AI provides current information with citations
- Disclaimers are automatically added for web-sourced information

## Testing Web Search

Try these example queries to test the web search functionality:

1. **Current Trends:**

   - "What are the current L'OrÃ©al skincare trends?"
   - "Any recent innovations in beauty routines?"

2. **Product Information:**

   - "What are the latest reviews for CeraVe products?"
   - "Any new recommendations for dry skin routines?"

3. **Expert Advice:**
   - "What do current dermatologists recommend for anti-aging?"
   - "Latest research on hyaluronic acid in skincare?"

## Fallback Behavior
